Poha recipe is a popular Maharashtrian breakfast made from flattened rice, herbs and spices. It is a staple breakfast in our home which we all love. In this post, I share two tasty recipes that are vegan and gluten-free.



Flattened rice or beaten rice
Beaten rice, flattened rice or parched rice are the different words to denote Poha. To make beaten rice, the rice grains are parboiled and then flattened.
These are like dry, crisp, thin flakes that can be crumbled or broken easily. Recipes made with flattened rice requires little to no cooking.
In some regional Indian languages, poha is known as phov (konkani), avalakki (karnataka), aval (tamil & malayalam), atukulu (telugu), chira (bengali), paunva (gujarati) and as pauwa in hindi.
Poha absorbs any liquids (water or milk) that they are soaked in and soften. So they can be eaten raw after soaking or cooked a bit.
They are also fried or roasted and made into quick snacks like Poha Chiwda.
In India, we get flattened rice easily. Making any dish with them is a breeze.
If you live outside India, then you can buy flattened rice in an Indian or asian grocery store or online.
There are basically two types of poha available in the market depending on their thickness. One is a papery thin version and the other is a thicker variety.
While in some recipes they can be used interchangeably, but in this poha recipe, always use the thicker poha.
We also get red poha or brown poha (made from red or brown rice). You can even use these to make this breakfast dish.




2. Poha Recipe
Poha recipe is a light breakfast dish. Basically pohe is made by mixing flattened rice in a mix of seasoned spices and onions.
It is ridiculously easy to make poha recipe. To make it more nutritious you can add boiled peas, grated carrots, roasted peanuts, cashews and garnish with coriander leaves (cilantro leaves) and grated coconut.
There are many variations of the recipe. Example: If you are adding potatoes then you can either fry them or steam them. One more tasty version is Indori Poha which has fennel seeds as one of the spices.
I have grown up having pohe for breakfast apart from Idli, Dosa and Upma. My mom used to make it often for breakfast or for brunch.


About Kanda Poha
In Marathi language, the word “Kanda” means onions. By now you know that the Maharashtrian word for flattened or beaten rice is Poha. Hence the term Kanda Poha or Kanda Pohe.
In some variations of poha recipe, potato is added instead of onions. Some people like to add both onions and potatoes.
I always add red onions that give a nice sweetish taste. If you are not a fan of red onions, you can try making the recipe with white onions or yellow onions.
