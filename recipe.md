How to make Poha
Preparation
1. Rinse 1.5 cups thick poha (flattened rice) in water until they soften. Use a strainer or colander to rinse these light rice flakes.
Remember not too rinse them too much or else they will break and become mushy. During rinsing, they will absorb water and soften.
The poha flakes ideally should soften but remain in shape and intact. If the they do not become soft, sprinkle some splashes of water on them so that they absorb some extra water.

2. Drain all of the water. The pohe should loose their crunchiness, crispiness and when you break them between your finger, they should easily get crushed or mashed. Set aside.

3. Now add 1 teaspoon sugar (or as required), salt as per taste, and ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder to the pohe and gently mix with a spoon or with clean hands.

Helpful Tips
Texture of soaked poha: After rinsing them well, press a flake and if it gets crushed/mashed easily then it is soft enough to be cooked. Otherwise, if it is dry and does not get mashed easily then sprinkle little water over it and gently mix well.
Rinsing: I usually rinse these flakes in a strainer or colander under running water and don’t soak them in water. Rinsing these softens them easily.
Veggies: You can also add boiled peas or grated carrots. This makes this dish more healthy and nutritious.
Garnish: I also like to add grated fresh coconut in my poha recipe but you can skip if you do not have coconut.
Type of poha: I use both red and white poha to make kanda poha. I have updated this post with step by step photos, where the dish is made with white poha but the final photos has the dish made with red poha.
